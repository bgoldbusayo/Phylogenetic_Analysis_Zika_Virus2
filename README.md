# Phylogenetic_Analysis_Zika_Virus2
I've analyzed Zika virus genomes. I started by checking and trimming raw sequencing data with FastQC and Trimmomatic, then assembled consensus genomes. I then curated a global dataset from NCBI, downsampling it by country and date. I aligned all sequences with MAFFT, cleaned the alignment, and built a phylogenetic tree using IQ-TREE and iTOL.
